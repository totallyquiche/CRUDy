# CRUDy

CRUDy is a PHP framework for classic CRUD sites. It has zero dependencies (excluding an optional database) and runs right from PHP's built-in server!

Features:
- Routing
- Templating
- Testing
- PSR-4 autoloading
- MVC architecture
- Custom environment variables (.env)
- Database abstraction

_WARNING: CRUDy shouldn't be used in production. This project is for my own fun and education but feel free to share your feedback or even open a pull request!_
