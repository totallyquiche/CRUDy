# CRUDy

CRUDy is a PHP framework for classic CRUD sites.

Everything is built from scratch here -- you won't find any dependencies in that `composer.json`, just some autoloading config.

## But why?

For fun, of course! In this case, "fun" and "education" are pretty closely tied. CRUDy is helping me hone my PHP skills and understand more about the concepts larger PHP frameworks are built on.

CRUDy is _not_ meant to be used in production. I'm not doing anything here that hasn't been done a million times (and a million times better) by other engineers. If you're looking for a lightweight PHP framework to use in the real world, check out [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) or [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/).

Feedback is still welcome! You can even open up a Pull Request if you'd like. :smile:
